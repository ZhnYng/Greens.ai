This project is a web application for users to classify vegetables using machine learning models. The main focus is on implementing MLOps practices, including the integration of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Overview

The web application allows users to upload images of vegetables and receive predictions on their types or classes. It leverages machine learning models trained on vegetable datasets to perform classification tasks. The project emphasizes MLOps practices to ensure efficient model development, deployment, and maintenance.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.
- Integration of machine learning models for vegetable classification.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, model training, and deployment.
- Monitoring and logging to track model performance and usage.
